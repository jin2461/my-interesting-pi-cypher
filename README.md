# my-interesting-pi-cypher
I made a cypher using rust, not very secure, but pretty fun YOU CAN ONLY USE LOWERCASE AND SPACE, NO OTHER TYPES OF CHARACTERS

The way it works is by first, converting the messege into an array of numbers, then adding a digit of pi from the offset of the key the user proveds.
after that, it converts the numbers back into letters.
The main threat to this cipher is brute force, as there are not that many keys
